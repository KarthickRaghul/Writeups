**Question :**

You are given a deck of cards represented by a string array `cards`, and each card displays two lowercase letters.

You are also given a letter `x`. You play a game with the following rules:

- Start with 0 points.
- On each turn, you must find two **compatible** cards from the deck that both contain the letter `x` in any position.
- Remove the pair of cards and earn **1 point**.
- The game ends when you can no longer find a pair of compatible cards.

Return the **maximum** number of points you can gain with optimal play.

Two cards are **compatible** if the strings differ in **exactly** 1 position.

**Example 1:**

> **Input:** cards = ["aa","ab","ba","ac"], x = "a"
> 
> **Output:** 2
> 
> **Explanation:**
> 
> - On the first turn, select and remove cards `"ab"` and `"ac"`, which are compatible because they differ at only index 1.  
> - On the second turn, select and remove cards `"aa"` and `"ba"`, which are compatible because they differ at only index 0.
> 
> Because there are no more compatible pairs, the total score is 2.

**Example 2:**

> **Input:** cards = ["aa","ab","ba"], x = "a"
> 
> **Output:** 1
> 
> **Explanation:**
> 
> - On the first turn, select and remove cards `"aa"` and `"ba"`.
> 
> Because there are no more compatible pairs, the total score is 1.

**Example 3:**

> **Input:** cards = ["aa","ab","ba","ac"], x = "b"
> 
> **Output:** 0
> 
> **Explanation:**
> 
> The only cards that contain the character `'b'` are `"ab"` and `"ba"`. However, they differ in both indices, so they are not compatible. Thus, the output is 0.

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= cards.length <= 105`
- `cards[i].length == 2`
- Each `cards[i]` is composed of only lowercase English letters between `'a'` and `'j'`.
- `x` is a lowercase English letter between `'a'` and `'j'`.

**Solution :**

```java
class Solution {
    public int score(String[] cards, char x) {
        int[] left = new int[10];
        int[] right = new int[10];
        int both = 0;
        int l = 0;
        int r = 0;
        for(String i : cards){
            if(i.charAt(0) == x && i.charAt(1) == x){
                both++;
            }
            else if(i.charAt(0) == x){
                left[i.charAt(1)-'a']++;
                l++;
            }
            else if(i.charAt(1) == x){
                right[i.charAt(0)-'a']++;
                r++;
            }
        }
        int maxL = 0;
        int maxR = 0;
        for(int i=0; i<10; i++){
            maxL = Math.max(maxL, left[i]);
            maxR = Math.max(maxR, right[i]); 
        }
        int pairA = Math.min(l / 2, l - maxL);
        int unpaired = l - 2 * pairA;
        int pairB = Math.min(r / 2, r - maxR);
        unpaired += r - 2 * pairB;
        int ans = pairA + pairB + Math.min(both, unpaired);
        if(both > unpaired){
            ans += Math.min(pairA + pairB, (both - unpaired) / 2);
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
