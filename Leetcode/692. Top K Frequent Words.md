**Question : **

Given an array of strings `words` and an integer `k`, return _the_ `k` _most frequent strings_.

Return the answer **sorted** by **the frequency** from highest to lowest. Sort the words with the same frequency by their **lexicographical order**.

**Example 1:**

> **Input:** words = ["i","love","leetcode","i","love","coding"], k = 2
> **Output:** ["i","love"]
> **Explanation:** "i" and "love" are the two most frequent words.
> Note that "i" comes before "love" due to a lower alphabetical order.

**Example 2:**

> **Input:** words = ["the","day","is","sunny","the","the","the","sunny","is","is"], k = 4
> **Output:** ["the","is","sunny","day"]
> **Explanation:** "the", "is", "sunny" and "day" are the four most frequent words, with the number of occurrence being 4, 3, 2 and 1 respectively.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= words.length <= 500`
- `1 <= words[i].length <= 10`
- `words[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.
- `k` is in the range `[1, The number of **unique** words[i]]`

**Follow-up:** Could you solve it in `O(n log(k))` time and `O(n)` extra space?

**Solution:**

```java
class Solution {
    public List<String> topKFrequent(String[] words, int k) {
        Map<String, Integer> freq = new HashMap<>();

        for (String w : words)
            freq.put(w, freq.getOrDefault(w, 0) + 1);

        PriorityQueue<String> pq =
            new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> {
                if (freq.get(a).equals(freq.get(b)))
                    return b.compareTo(a);
                return freq.get(a) - freq.get(b);
            });

        for (String word : freq.keySet()) {
            pq.offer(word);
            if (pq.size() > k) pq.poll();
        }

        List<String> res = new ArrayList<>();
        while (!pq.isEmpty())
            res.add(pq.poll());

        Collections.reverse(res);
        return res;
    }
}
